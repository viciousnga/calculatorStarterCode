# calculatorStarterCode
This project is a calulator that uses operations such as addition, 
subtraction, division, addition, square root, powers, logBase10 and
can generate a random number. The project functions through java script and
the code 'function', an example would be 'function subtract(x,y)  { reutrn x*y; }'.
If I had more time, I would add functions that could utilize the sine,
cosine, and tangent operation.
